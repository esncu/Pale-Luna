# Pale Luna
SFBA, 1990s.

You find a dusty floppy in your school's storeroom. It faintly has the words _Pale Luna_ sharpied on it.

Online reviews say it's the worst text-based adventure ever made, with almost all copies being destroyed. Still, it's a rare find, so you plug it into your computer to find out what made it so enigmatic.

## Info
Based on [the Pale Luna creepypasta](https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Pale_Luna), this adaption is a lil bit fancier with text animations, but is mostly faithful to the source material.

This was mainly made to test out bitwise operations for storage, and a certain graphics protocol for Linux/MacOS which is not yet implemented on v1.0.

## Installation
